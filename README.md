# Coding challenges

The goal of this repository is to improve SQL programming skills with a coding challenge. The implementation of these challenges follows the methodology of Test-Driven Development, i.e.:

- Think about tests cases
- Write the tests
- Implement the code
- Test
- Refactoring
- Test again until all tests pass

The challenges are based on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) exercises.
