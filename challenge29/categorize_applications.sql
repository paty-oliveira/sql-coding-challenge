    As part of streamlining the hiring process at tech company, we aim to categorize all job applications into two distinct groups based on their evaluation status:

    1. Rejected: Applications where the candidate did not meet the necessary criteria for the role, including technical skills, company cultural fit, or other qualifications as determined by the hiring team.
    2. Approved: Applications where the candidate successfully met or exceeded the evaluation criteria and are considered strong candidates for the next stages of the hiring process.

    To achieve this, we use the applications table, where each application has a status represented by the application_status column. A status value of 5 or lower indicates a rejected application, while a status value greater than 5 indicates an approved application.

    applications:
    - application_id (int): primary key
    - application_status: The status of the job application, represented by an integer.

    Result Set Columns:

    1. status_group: This column categorizes the applications into two groups: 'Rejected' and 'Approved'. We display 'Rejected' at first. The categorization is based on the value of the application_status column in the applications table:
        - 'Rejected': Applications with an application_status value of 5 or lower.
        - 'Approved': Applications with an application_status value greater than 5.

    2. application_num: The number of applications in each status group. This column provides a count of applications that fall into the 'Rejected' or 'Approved' categories.

    We always have to see both categories in the results, even if one or both of the counts is zero.

    For this sample data:

    | application_id | application_status |
    +----------------+--------------------+
    | 1              | 3                  |
    | 2              | 6                  |
    | 3              | 4                  |
    | 4              | 7                  |
    | 5              | 5                  |
    | 6              | 8                  |
    | 7              | 2                  |
    | 8              | 9                  |

    the expected output of the query is following:

    | status_group  | application_num|
    +---------------+----------------+
    | Rejected      | 4              |
    | Approved      | 4              |

SELECT 'Rejected' AS status_group,
  COALESCE(COUNT(application_status), 0) AS application_num
FROM applications
WHERE application_status <= 5

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Approved' AS status_group,
    COALESCE(COUNT(application_status), 0) AS application_num
FROM applications
WHERE application_status > 5
